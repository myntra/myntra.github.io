title: Visibility Part 3 - Contextual Visibility
---

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This is the third part of the series of articles on visibility. The previous articles being - <a href="http://sartorialscience.myntrablogs.com/2014/12/visibility-part-1-product-ranking.html" target="_blank">Visibility-Product Ranking</a> and <a href="http://sartorialscience.myntrablogs.com/2014/12/visibility-part-2-multi-storefronts.html" target="_blank">Visibility-Multi Storefronts</a>. While the previous articles talk about the general ranking algorithms and maintaining multiple stores, the subject of the current article is around contextual visibility.<br /><br /><h4>Why contextual?</h4>The general product ranking algorithm is majorly influenced by what the larger customer base or audience is doing on the website. In a nut shell, most of the product listing is derived from the wisdom of the crowd or the inherent demand signals at a store level. On the other hand extreme <a href="http://sartorialscience.myntrablogs.com/2014/12/every-customer-gets-his-own-aisle-hyper.html" target="_blank">personalisation</a> talks about knowing the customer well and then customising the store experience. All these approaches miss the current context of an individual which when used can augment the store experience significantly. e.g. A man looking for trousers in the chilly winters can be communicated with woollen trousers' collection; based on the body type and occasion, the proposition can be further enhanced to have choice of fit - a slim or a regular fit as well.<br /><br /><h4>Why is it necessary?</h4>On one hand this approach help user's to explore unique concepts present in the store relevant to the current context, as well help get focussed and relevant attention to products which otherwise get hidden in the wide choices that we offer. Version 1 take on this approach has been implemented by <a href="http://sartorialscience.myntrablogs.com/2014/12/senseable-interventions.html" target="_blank">Sense</a>.<br /><br /><h4>How is "the context" derived?</h4>Context is derived by crunching a lot of signals we have accumulated over time for a user, e.g. the devices being used, the channels to access the store, the products selected and clicked, the products added to cart, usage of search, choice of filters, brands seen, etc.<br /><br /><h4>Is it real-time?</h4>Yes. We have the context engine running 24X7 establishing context for millions of visits that we get everyday and is triggered as soon as someone starts interacting with the store.</div>
