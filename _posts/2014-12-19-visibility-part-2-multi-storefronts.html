title: Visibility Part 2 - Multi storefronts
---

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This is the second part of the series of articles on visibility. The first one being&nbsp;<a href="http://sartorialscience.blogspot.in/2014/12/visibility-part-1-product-ranking.html">Visibility Part 1 - Product Ranking</a>.<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">What's lacking in the current approach?</h4><div>In the first article it was discussed as to how visibility is affected, measurement metrics, relation with product ranking and general considerations of the product ranking algorithm. The solution discussed revolved around establishing the relative importance of one product over the other (point in time) ultimately translating into one of the many possible configuration of an aisle or storefront. In the current scheme, only a small number of products get visibility over and over again leaving a large chunk of products with limited visibility and hence lower sales. The problem of "the lack of visibility" to a long tail of products is not addressed by this mechanism which is what we tried to address with the multi-storefront approach.</div><div><br /></div><h4 style="text-align: left;">The concept</h4><div>Multi-store is an aisle organisation mechanism to portray a wider width on the listing pages. This helps in out-of-turn promotion of products leading to better visibility distribution across products and overall better sales mix. The multi-store aisle organisation is achieved by identifying potential best-sellers amongst the low visible products and then infusing them with the regular "product ranked order" products. On the website this translates to different visitors getting different aisle or storefront organisations at the same time.</div><div><br /></div><div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zHbR7Lri9j4/VJPSIlYn4eI/AAAAAAAAGBA/7-DamDBC8WY/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-19%2Bat%2B12.51.10%2Bpm.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zHbR7Lri9j4/VJPSIlYn4eI/AAAAAAAAGBA/7-DamDBC8WY/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-19%2Bat%2B12.51.10%2Bpm.png" height="170" width="200" /></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_EOSsL9CnVg/VJPSIoN1AyI/AAAAAAAAGA8/gJL3WyoT3ng/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-19%2Bat%2B12.51.26%2Bpm.png" imageanchor="1" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_EOSsL9CnVg/VJPSIoN1AyI/AAAAAAAAGA8/gJL3WyoT3ng/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-19%2Bat%2B12.51.26%2Bpm.png" height="170" width="200" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Note that two visitors getting exposed to two different storefronts of men casual shirts at the same time instance.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><h4 style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Results</h4><div>The multi-store concept has been extended to more than two stores and has been in production for more than a year now. The following benefits have been observed</div><div>1. a better sales mix<br />2. newly introduced styles getting default visibility<br />3. enables extra aisle space to cater to changing business needs</div><!--EndFragment--></div></div>
