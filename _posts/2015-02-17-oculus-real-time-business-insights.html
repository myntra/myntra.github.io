title: Oculus - Real Time Business Insights

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">There's a growing need for modern businesses to react faster to events happening inside their business. For online retailers where the store experience can be changed on the fly, it becomes all the more important to have a hold of critical information in real-time. Traditionally analytics have been either based on web analytics tools such as GA, Omniture, etc. or in-house transactional systems which manage orders, customers, inventory, etc. These systems beyond a point not help in getting a visibility of a lot of important business metrics. For instance, understanding gender based browsing patterns, page/storefront performance, storefront wise discount leakage, visibility of revenue earned till now, revenue projection, traffic distribution, etc. Each one of these if measured during the day, can help build deep understanding of business as it happens and leads to a more informed business decision towards maximising various goals. Some practical examples can be, reduction of discounts on a page where there is more leakage or promoting pages where discounts have been put and is short of traffic, what time of the day to put discounts on women's products, who are the people on the website right now and creating interesting propositions, etc. Our solution to these problems is "Oculus" which is a real time analytics engine aggregating visits on the website and delivering meaningful business insights right when it is required.<br /><br /><div>Case in point are the below charts from Oculus that help understand the demand of categories and brands trending right now.<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-opE4rvZqSJs/VOGCAw2f0LI/AAAAAAAAAEE/4OiV6RnJszI/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-02-08%2Bat%2B11.43.27%2Bpm.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-opE4rvZqSJs/VOGCAw2f0LI/AAAAAAAAAEE/4OiV6RnJszI/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-02-08%2Bat%2B11.43.27%2Bpm.png" height="116" width="200" /></a></span><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b-igEs0UuD0/VOGCBVIJurI/AAAAAAAAAEM/E61wTJky-AU/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-02-08%2Bat%2B11.43.39%2Bpm.png" imageanchor="1" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b-igEs0UuD0/VOGCBVIJurI/AAAAAAAAAEM/E61wTJky-AU/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-02-08%2Bat%2B11.43.39%2Bpm.png" height="112" width="200" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Business at the speed of thought!
