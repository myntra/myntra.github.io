title: Sense(able) interventions
---

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><h4 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h4>As an avid users of various fashion e-commerce platforms ourselves, at times we miss quality human interventions which can inform about the latest fashionable trends, stop us from making obvious fashion bloopers and offer help in choosing the right fit, colour, size, etc. The most obvious source of information today is the print media in the form of fashion magazines or fashion blogs maintained by individuals/companies. These rich sources of specialised fashion content can be at times overwhelming and takes quite some time on part of the user to absorb. Another difficulty lies in the access to this information (right information at the right time) while the purchase decisions are being made.<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">Enter the "Sense" world</h4>What if we change the equation and approach the problem in a different way? Rather than overloading the user with fashion content upfront and pray the user goes through it, we understand the user first, understand what he/her is looking for (derive the context) and then have a more meaningful conversation around the fit, trending fashion, colour selection, etc. This is what "Sense" is all about. Crisply, it is a real-time processing engine which senses the presence of a user on the website, figures out all the past and current web interactions and tries to derive a context. The context has two faces, the first being "the short term intent" which explains what a user is interested in right now and the "long term taste and profile" which defines what a user likes in general. There are tons of user signals we use to derive the context, some of which are, the channel used to approach the website, landing pages, product pages, user searches, banner clicks, etc.<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">How can we use this?</h4>There are broadly two ways we can use the derived context in general by<br />(a) having a more meaningful contextual conversation with the user based on the his tastes, likings and h(is|er) current interest.<br />(b) subtly changing the website to mould itself around the users' current interests.<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">The current state</h4>The system is up and running for all desktop users right now. An example of "Sense" in action would be, if a user is looking for formal shirts there are high chances that we would be pushing a website notification informing the user about "magnetic button-down shirts" which is essentially a limited edition Invictus shirt collection having magnets to hold the collar down instead of buttons. The notification would look something like this and upon click would lead to the magnetic buttoned-down products by Invictus.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_vxp8cjmhW4/VIaLI5v4VfI/AAAAAAAAF5w/T8bCPQ1A5SQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-09%2Bat%2B10.59.16%2Bam.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_vxp8cjmhW4/VIaLI5v4VfI/AAAAAAAAF5w/T8bCPQ1A5SQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-09%2Bat%2B10.59.16%2Bam.png" height="348" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">How does it help our customers and us?</h4>On one hand, our customers benefit by getting introduced to unique product concepts and their crisp introduction without too much of self-motived content exploration. Also the communication being context aware (since it is real-time and based on their likings, preferences and short term intent) helps boost the shopping experience in a major way. On the other hand, the button-down collection gets focused visibility by formal shirt buyers and communicates the uniqueness in the collection crisply thereby increasing the chances of it getting discovered and sold from the huge selection of formal shirts that we already have. It's one of the possible many use-cases where we are using "Sense" as a kind of micro-messaging platform wherein the messages are getting published in real-time in an automated way driven by users' taste and current intent in general.</div>
