We did an open Hackday, and we called it Hackerramp!

Hackerramp, Myntra’s first open hackathon happened on the weekend of April 25-26 2015. Thanks to all the 180 participants who made this event a grand success. We had around 35 teams presenting their amazing hacks to the Jury.

The goal was simple - make the next big thing in mobile. Be it an app, an API or even something related to mobile security. For more than 24 hours, keeping themselves fuelled on Red Bull, the teams raced the clock and converted their ideas into real working demos.

# Preparations

Myntra had done a Hackday in the past, but this was the first time we opened to everyone, which meant we had to get this right. There was a lot of preparation put in. There had to be great food throughout the day, great talks to kick off the event and some great goodies for the participants to take home!
