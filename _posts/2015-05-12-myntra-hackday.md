Hackerramp, Myntraâ€™s first open hackathon came to a close on April 26th 2015 at 1pm. We had around 35 teams totalling around 180 participants in all who sweat it out through 24 hours to build the next best thing in mobile.
Out of the many teams, only 16 were shortlisted to make it to the final selection by our eminent jury consisting of Amit Somani, Pramod Verma, Amod Malviya and Shamik Sharma.
