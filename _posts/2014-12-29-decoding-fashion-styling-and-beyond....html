<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div>We know what people purchase and also what they browse. But we don’t know what they wear.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s likely that apart from the customer, anyone would struggle in answering this question. This obviously includes us. No wonder ‘people who bought this also bought’ sections on prominent apparel retailer sites are often contextually irrelevant when it comes to cross-selling of products. How often do we see a footwear being recommended with a selected trouser making a sensible match?</div><div><br></div><div>So, here’s how we think of unclogging this problem:</div><div>1) Understanding and codifying the principles behind fashion styling</div><div>2) Using them for styling</div><div>3) Keep refining and discovering more of them<br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yM8D6hP7aYo/VKEZalkpFZI/AAAAAAAABuw/SqrrCTHnZLU/s1600/diag1.tiff" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yM8D6hP7aYo/VKEZalkpFZI/AAAAAAAABuw/SqrrCTHnZLU/s1600/diag1.tiff" height="270" width="400"></a></div><br></div><div><div>As depicted above, this has to be a highly iterative process of discovery, application and refinement. So lets take off the ground by addressing the elephant in the room - <i>what are the principles of fashion styling</i>?</div><div><div><br></div></div><div><b>Principles of fashion styling</b></div><div>All of us would agree that there have to be a set of implicit rules or patterns at work which the stylists apply before advising their clients to spruce up. This knack of making over someone’s appearance cannot be totally arbitrary. It is evident that choosing cuts and fabric, combining colours, accessorising and a whole gamut of other styling tricks are based on certain solid principles or rules(of thumb). The stylists then of course creatively improvise and customise these principles for catering to client requirements. This said, we now want to build an automated web-scale solution - for which we definitely need these ‘rules’.So, how do we enable such a discovery?</div><div><br></div><div>Lets consider one of the facets of styling - accessorising. For suggesting appropriate accessories, one needs to know which piece gels with which outfit, say for an occasion. Is it possible to ask our stylists to enlist ‘rules’ underlying accessorising? Now, there are few problems crippling this approach - will it capture myriad combinations (read combinatorial explosion) possible?; given that trends are dynamic by nature and multiple such facets to be covered, how feasible is it to do such an exercise often? Not to mention the possibility of various biases creeping in due to lack of diverse opinion.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Illustration of some styling rules discovered from Myntra MY STYLIST outfits</b></div><div>If directly tapping styling knowledge is challenging, we can mine stylist data to unearth some implicit rules. As an illustration, we have taken 900+ MY STYLIST outfits(as of this writing), filtered on the female gender and derived the following insights. It is not an exhaustive rules list by any measure but it opens up possibilities.</div><div><br></div><div><i>1) Category pairing rules</i></div><div><br></div><div>The figure below depicts the proportional co-occurrence of different accessories with dresses, kurtas and tops respectively. It serves as a guide on accesorizing for these categories. For instance we notice that clutches tag well with dresses whereas for tops handbags seem the best sell. Similarly, kurtas and legging seem wonder match whereas with tops skirts/jeans/trousers go great.</div></div><div><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i2knBu-6vIk/VKEa8ZpREzI/AAAAAAAABvY/oOM8OWGogsA/s1600/cat-pairs1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i2knBu-6vIk/VKEa8ZpREzI/AAAAAAAABvY/oOM8OWGogsA/s1600/cat-pairs1.png" height="224" width="640"></a></div><div><br></div><div><div><div><i>2) Attributes pairing rules</i></div></div><div><br></div><div>This illustration is a deep dive into various attributes of earrings. Drilling down the earring types for dresses, kurtas and tops, it emerges that drop earrings pair well with kurtas whereas stud earrings seem more popular with tops and dresses.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jLgoL3YLVwI/VKEa8Q3zlBI/AAAAAAAABvQ/3Dx9btlkTO8/s1600/attr-pair1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jLgoL3YLVwI/VKEa8Q3zlBI/AAAAAAAABvQ/3Dx9btlkTO8/s1600/attr-pair1.png" height="206" width="640"></a></div><div><br></div><div><div><i>3) Deducing colour combinations</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>In this segment, we will interpret how colour combinations interplay towards pairing of tops and trousers. Looking at black, burgundy, red and white tops we can make out which trouser colour strike along best.<br><br></div></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O-uSwXbSPwo/VKEa8TQalkI/AAAAAAAABvU/G9BlEzl-xFU/s1600/colour-pairs1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O-uSwXbSPwo/VKEa8TQalkI/AAAAAAAABvU/G9BlEzl-xFU/s1600/colour-pairs1.png" height="190" width="640"></a></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>Web-data, wisdom of crowds and gamification</b></div><div>These illustrations point out how the output from a handful of stylists can be useful in obtaining some of the principles behind fashion styling . We therefore must do the following to improve on our baseline:</div><div><br></div><div>1) Spread out further on the web to as many sources as possible for collecting rich styling data viz. look-books, content, outfits and so on. Yes, these sources could be social fashion engines like ASOS fashion-finder, Polyvore, Chicismo; intelligence providers like Editd, Wsgn and web APIs of Pinterest, Wanelo etc.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>2) Other key area to be focused at would be having an ongoing stream of user generated fashion content via some sort of gamification. Moreover, when we want to understand and profile the myriad fashion tastes of customers, collective judgement of large group of people will definitely be more accurate than the judgement of a handful of experts. As proved by some social fashion engines, this area is hot iron for applying wisdom of crowds. Internally, we noticed that pooled browsing behaviour of millions of site visitors gave us a nuanced understanding of merchandise similarity -&nbsp;which would be impossible when relying solely on product attributes. The similarity data powers most of the existing and upcoming personalisation features on the site.</div></div><div><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-doZbuvO5dMc/VKEZbJD1F9I/AAAAAAAABu8/0JNmo5FeX2U/s1600/diag2.tiff" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-doZbuvO5dMc/VKEZbJD1F9I/AAAAAAAABu8/0JNmo5FeX2U/s1600/diag2.tiff" height="176" width="400"></a></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>It comes across that an approach thriving on extensive amounts of fashion data would be enormously effective. We’re experimenting with ASOS outfits data to have a data mashup on fashion styling.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Personalised Outfit Suggestion Engine(POSE)</b></div><div>Above library/repository of styling rules derived in the form of discrete probability distributions can be principally combined together using bayesian reasoning and machine learning tools for a variety of problems. An interesting application would be to come up with a <b>personalised outfit suggestion engine(POSE)</b>&nbsp; as opposed to regular cross-selling. The POSE comes to cater to the unique merchandise preferences of a customer. Leveraging on product level affinities from interaction data(browse &amp; purchases) and the evolving knowledge base on fashion styling, will enable us to deliver this solution. We’ll talk more about POSE in the subsequent posts.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Eventually a knowledge base on Indian fashion</b></div><div>Myntra platform is uniquely positioned to amass a wealth of data on Indian fashion and styling preferences. We posses detailed knowledge of product attributes on a vast catalogue. To boot that up, we have browsing, search and transactions data from millions of people. </div><div>We are planning to enable the insights, derived from our platform, openly accessible to the various players in the apparel ecosystem viz. manufacturers, designers, private boutiques/labels, fashion incubators, bloggers, content aggregators. Myntra will establish such social capital and thereby benefit from its consequential network effects. Further, this democratisation of knowledge has tremendous potential to level the playing field between fashion experts and non-experts in this industry. This in turn will throw the gates open for everyone to innovate, design and put up their stuff. We sketch a parallel here with the publishing industry which revolutionised with the ushering in of blogging platforms.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We welcome more thoughts on this. So lets keep the chat on.</div></div><div><br></div></div>
