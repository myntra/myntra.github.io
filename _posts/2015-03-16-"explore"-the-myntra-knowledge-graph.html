title: '"Explore" the Myntra knowledge graph'
---

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><h4 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h4>Routinely there are multitudes of questions that one like to get answers to, to first understand how people interact with Myntra.com and then optimise their store experience. These questions come in different variety and from different functions in the organisation, ranging from store managers to merchandisers to business analysts wherein each of them are looking at data with a different perspective altogether. Case in point being merchandisers looking to understand how their brands fared and store managers looking to understand which store fronts did well and which needs attention.<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">Solution Design</h4>The questions that are routinely asked for are on the following line<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>how many eyeballs a particular brand got and from where</li><li>which storefronts are the ones which are leading to more views and conversion</li><li>where is the brand and article types getting sold from</li><li>what gets sold from a storefront</li><li>which pages do the most profitable customers go on the website</li><li>how do people interact with top-navigation pages</li><li>what gets used along with brand filter of a particular brand</li></ul><br />and potentially many more. Possibly infinite.<br /><br />One way to solve this is to act reactively and try to write jobs which compute answers to these specific questions individually and then made available in some database table or through some static report. Downside of this approach being loss of agility (development takes time!!) and effort required to look at multiple reports and making sense of it.<br /><br />The approach being proposed here is to create a knowledge graph which would represent all major interactions happening on Myntra.com.<br /><br />The three fundamental entities in the knowledge graph are<br />1. The <b>nodes</b> in the graph. Some sample nodes are listed below<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Brand nodes - Nike, Puma, Roadster etc.</li><li>Filter nodes - Size 8, Size 9, Fabric Cotton etc.</li><li>Navigation Page nodes - men casual shoes, men tees polos, etc.</li><li>Banner nodes - Wrogn, Anouk, etc.</li></ul><br />2. The <b>edges</b> are the connections between these nodes. For instance some potential nodes to which "Roadster" node in the graph would be connected to could be<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Navigation page nodes - men casual shoes, men sports shoes</li><li>Filter nodes - size 8, size 9</li><li>Content - roadster shop in shop</li><li>Consumer - high margin customers</li></ul><br />3. The <b>data </b>on the node itself. Some potential data points that can exist on "Roadster" brand node<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Popular storefronts Roadster is discovered from</li><li>Popular article type visibility of Roadster</li><li>Discount visibility of Roadster</li><li>Popular user searches to discover Roadster</li><li>Filters used with Roadster</li><li>Top pages Roadster is sold from</li></ul><div><br /></div><h4 style="text-align: left;">Usage</h4><h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The knowledge graph once created can then be exposed through an UI where users can search for nodes of interest (say brand Roadster or Casual Shoes article type) and see the data/details present on the node. The next step can be to hop on to any of the next linked node to continue on the data discovery journey.</span></h4><h4 style="text-align: left;"></h4><h4 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h4><h4 style="text-align: left;">Implementation</h4><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The system is called "Explore" which essentially computes hundreds of thousands of interesting aggregates daily, creates the graph structure and exposes it through an easily navigable UI.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Happy "Explore"ing...</span></div></div>
