title: User Journey Model and its Application
---

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal">Every day, thousands of users browse through fashionable products on Myntra. Users might visit Myntra directly, or through other channels such as internet search, mailers or social media. Once they land on the website or mobile app, they typically browse through several products before making a purchase. Understanding users' journey as they find a product of interest is therefore complicated, but important.<br /><br />We at Myntra, are building a predictive model to understand user journeys. This 'User Journey Model' is built by learning browsing patterns from millions of historical samples, using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The model can predict a user's journey, given his or her recent browsing history. Such a model can be helpful in several use cases including digital marketing, personalised navigation, and personalised search. As a sample use case of the User Journey Model, let's see how it can help us in digital marketing.<br /><br /><b>Dynamic User Segments for Digital Marketing</b><br /><br />"<i>Whom</i> to target, and <i>when</i>?" is an important question to ask while targeting users for digital marketing. &nbsp;Often, the strategy is to identify users at the end of the conversion funnel. We can think of this funnel as a user's journey through Myntra as s/he decides to buy a product. In other words, the more a user is towards the end of the conversion funnel, the higher is his or her intent to buy. For example, a user may not have purchased a product yet, however he or she may have added it to cart. It is a good idea to target such users, as they are towards the end of the funnel and therefore show high intent. We can create a user segment with the rule: 'include all users who have added a product to cart, but have not bought it'. Similarly, we can create several other rules to identify high intent users.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><i>However,</i> such event based rules allow us to detect only a limited set of high intent users. For example, a large number of users may like a certain product, but may not explicitly add it to cart or wish list. In this case, we may lose a big chunk of high intent users who could be potential buyers. Moreover, as many of the segments are more or less static (ex: registered but not bought), the same users tend to get bombarded with repeated emails. This can lead to low mail open rates and even unsubscribes.<br /><br />The User Journey Model can help us fill in such gaps. It can look at the recent browsing pattern of a user, and determine his or her intent. In other words, it tries to guess if a user is really interested in buying a product, even if he or she hasn't explicitly clicked on say, 'add to cart'. We can now dynamically create a segment of high intent users, in addition to segments created via event based rules. In case of mailers and SMS based campaigns, we can control the number of communications to send depending on users' level of intent. Essentially, we can target a user only <i>when</i> he shows high level of intent.<br /><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><div class="MsoNormal">Let us take a real example of determining intent of an individual user. Ashish is browsing for products in the following order:</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OoER4NzctkQ/VMeKjRXKIEI/AAAAAAAAALE/Pl0Lds_4SGM/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-27%2Bat%2B6.22.22%2Bpm.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OoER4NzctkQ/VMeKjRXKIEI/AAAAAAAAALE/Pl0Lds_4SGM/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-27%2Bat%2B6.22.22%2Bpm.png" height="153" width="640" /></a></div><br />He first looked at a Navy Blue Hooded Sweatshirt. However, later he started browsing for Jeans. The sports sandal towards the end could be a seen as a diversion from his intent. Such diversions are fairly common while browsing. This is exactly why, looking at the complete sequence is very important to identify the likely intent of the user, as it gives the necessary context.<br /><br />Given such a sequence of browsing, our algorithm can answer a couple of questions. First, what is the intent level of Ashish? Second, what are the exact products that he seems to show intent in.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LKGD6CldE7s/VLizki31y4I/AAAAAAAAAFM/m9-pTN9RHJw/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-16%2Bat%2B12.13.04%2Bpm.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LKGD6CldE7s/VLizki31y4I/AAAAAAAAAFM/m9-pTN9RHJw/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-16%2Bat%2B12.13.04%2Bpm.png" height="121" width="640" /></a></div><br />The User Journey Model answers in terms of a 'product group' or a group of similar products. Shown above is one of the product groups (Faded Jeans) which Ashish seems to show intent in, as determined by our algorithm. It also determines the level of intent he shows in this particular product group. We can now target Ashish, and other similar users in a campaign for 'Faded Jeans'. This is how we can dynamically form high intent user segments which are specific to product groups. Also, such information could be useful for re-marketing products to high intent users.<br /><br /><b>Creating Intent Based Campaigns</b></div>Since we have intent levels for all users, we can now aggregate them at the channel level across different product categories. The two heat maps below show how users' intent is spread across different product categories for every channel. The first heat map is for women's product categories, while the second one is for men. Simply put, we compare the shades in each row (darker shade implies more intent). As the users' intent changes, the intent seen across product categories and product groups also changes. Currently, we calculate intent on a daily basis. We can therefore create campaigns for the product categories showing high intent on a given day.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pt9i8KsdVbg/VMJas6VfWnI/AAAAAAAAAKM/bt8x5cic84U/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-23%2Bat%2B12.18.30%2Bpm.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pt9i8KsdVbg/VMJas6VfWnI/AAAAAAAAAKM/bt8x5cic84U/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-23%2Bat%2B12.18.30%2Bpm.png" height="355" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nYxcxJEPY4g/VMHyLr1evlI/AAAAAAAAAJY/8YQQ82pW96Y/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-23%2Bat%2B12.30.14%2Bpm.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nYxcxJEPY4g/VMHyLr1evlI/AAAAAAAAAJY/8YQQ82pW96Y/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-23%2Bat%2B12.30.14%2Bpm.png" height="290" title="Intent for Men Categories" width="400" /></a></div><br />For example, in the above heat maps, let us consider the Partnership channel. Among men categories, Sweatshirts and Sweaters seem to have higher user intent on the given day. Similarly, among women categories, we notice that Jackets and Shorts have higher user intent. Such information could be used along with recent campaign details to make a decision on which campaigns should be created or continued.<br /><br />To conclude, we believe that User Journey Model is a powerful tool and can help us in various use cases. We plan to launch intent based campaigns for digital marketing shortly.</div></div>
