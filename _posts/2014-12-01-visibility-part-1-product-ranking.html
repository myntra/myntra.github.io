<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><h4 style="text-align: left;">What is visibility?</h4><div>Product discovery is an essential step in the journey of any e-commerce transaction. What gets seen is what gets sold; tougher the discovery of a product, lower is the sales potential. In our scenario product discovery is primarily achieved by</div><div><ul><li>User driven actions through top-navigation pages, "search queries" on search bar, filtering and sorting.</li><li>Content interactions (on website) : Banner, look good, inline content, recommendations, breadcrumb, recently viewed&nbsp;etc.</li><li>Content interactions (off website) :&nbsp;Affiliates, google ads, remarketing, youtube, facebook, seo.</li></ul><div>Visibility is just an outcome of any of the above mentioned product discovery led activity that a user does.</div></div><div><br /></div><h4 style="text-align: left;"><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-weight: normal;"><h4 style="text-align: left;">How is it measured?</h4>Simply put, visibility can be defined as the number of eyeballs a product got through listing pages. Mathematically that translates to the sum total of listings happened for a product on any listing page across all visits. e.g. a visit to T-shirts list page will result in each product listed on the page getting counted as a "single list view". Summed over all visits for a day, we get the day total of list view or visibility for that product.<o:p></o:p><br /><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-weight: normal;"></div></h4><h4 style="text-align: left;">How is product ranking related to visibility?</h4><div>Product ranking is one of the key influencer in overall aisle organisation and hence directly impacts visibility of a product on the website. In short, product rank of a product is a "score" which determines it's importance when compared with another product. e.g. if on a list page (also called storefront) there are two styles to be displayed (aisle organisation), the product with a higher score is put before the lower score product. Generally speaking, higher the score better the chances of discovery leading to better visibility.</div><div><br /></div><h4 style="text-align: left;">Product ranking algorithm considerations</h4><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">The product ranking algorithm takes into account various factors to arrive at "the final score". Some of these considerations are velocity of sale, actual sale, margin, availability, list conversion, etc. Majority of the factors are a proxy to what customers' likes and dislikes are and only some are business objective driven. To accommodate parameters (like sale velocity) which are sensitive to day's proceedings, the product rankings are refreshed thrice a day. Also, some of these parameter levers are exposed to business users (to override) as well for them to adapt to changes happening during the day.<br /><br /></div><h4 style="text-align: left;">Visibility - A limited resource</h4><div class="MsoNormal"><div style="text-align: left;">Visibility is an outcome of varied complex interactions that a visitor goes through on the website. The product ranking which influences visibility in a major way not only follows customer demand patterns but considers broader business goals as well. On a side note, noticeable dips in revenue were observed when non-proven products were artificially pushed on top.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Visibility is a limited resource; gives great returns when carefully spent!</b></div></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div></div>
