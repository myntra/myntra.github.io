title: Understanding visibility as a key driver ...

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="p1">While we continuously work on decoding <a href="http://sartorialscience.myntrablogs.com/2015/01/user-journey-model-and-its-application.html" target="_blank">high-intent</a> traffic at <a href="http://www.myntra.com/" target="_blank">myntra</a>, it is equally imperative that we understand key drivers of conversion: price, visibility, portal experience, etc.. We have had multiple posts around visibility but today I wanted to take a stab at exploring some theoretical constructs in an attempt to better understand it. Brace yourself for a verbose post !!</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">Let me set up the context by comparing our 2 primary levers - price and visibility. Price as a key driver has been well studied in retail and we have a fair understanding of key constructs around pricing - <a href="http://sartorialscience.myntrablogs.com/2015/01/understanding-price-elasticity.html" target="">price elasticities</a>, price response curves and&nbsp;Willingness-To-Pay (WTP). The underlying connections for parametric distributions have also been drawn out; For e,g, constant elasticity is derived via a log-linear price response curve which is further hinged on an underlying exponential WTP distribution. In a highly discounted landscape, where customers are in some sense discount spoilt, an exponential WTP could be a reasonable assumption rather than a bell-curve WTP. At <a href="http://www.myntra.com/" target="_blank">myntra</a>, we are exploring with different price response curves on our historical data. Note that elasticity is just one of the levers towards price optimisation; Fine grained understanding and execution of all levers towards optimal and profitable pricing is a challenging task.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Compared to price, visibility has been less studied. Although offline brick and mortar stores are exposed to visibility as a lever and have leveraged it to tactically arrange styles at display, the underlying problem of product discovery which visibility is trying to solve is significantly less pronounced there as compared to an online store; Ratio of limited real estate versus the infinite breadth in products on an online portal is overwhelming and renders discoverability extremely challenging. While personalisation is the right approach to manage this ratio, we will still need to optimally allocate visibility.&nbsp;</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><b>Visibility Response Curves and Visibility Elasticity</b></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Visibility optimisation can be potentially approached in similar ways as price optimisation but with some caveats. To keep the discussion more focused, we will restrict the visibility problem to the list page property and the rank ordering of styles within a list page. As a first step, using historical data around the number of list views a product received and its corresponding sales, the visibility response curve and visibility elasticity - the % shift in demand of a product due to % shift in its visibility - can be estimated. The visibility response curve specifies the demand of a product as a function of the visibility offered to the product. As visibility decreases, demand declines; &nbsp;At an extreme level if we de-list a product we definitely won’t realise any sales for it. On the other end, as visibility achieves saturation, the lift in demand is marginal. So far, this has been a straightforward extension of price response curves.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><b>Consumer Behaviour Implications: Search vs Discovery</b></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Just like in the case of price response curves, can we say something about the implications of different shapes of the visibility response curve on the consumer behaviour? Assume we tactically reduce the visibility of a specific product or a collection, the consumer will now have to <i>search</i>&nbsp;a bit more if he needs to uncover this product. This brings out the fundamental difference between search and discovery. Search implies consumer has a fair idea of what he is looking for while the objective of discovery is to present product propositions to the consumer which he/she is not aware of yet would inspire him to <i>buy</i>. Lets take an example: if a person wants to buy a "Nike" running shoes, he has a fair idea of his want and does not need explicit marketing assistance from us. However, if someone is looking for running shoes in general and is not sure of the specific product, the salesmans' duty is to present to him the right product at the right price inducing a high chance of <i>conversion</i>.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">This implies that, unlike price response curve, the visibility response curve is hinged on a mixture of a) the distribution of customers’ having a clear knowledge of the product they want to buy plus an appetite to search and b) the distribution of consumers’ needing some assistance in discovering the product.&nbsp;Reducing visibility therefore implies that demand might dip because the product needs to now surface through a focused search and fewer customers of type (b) will now discover it. It will be interesting to see how varying parametric shapes around these distributions and different mixture functions affect the visibility response curve shapes.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><b>Cannibalisation</b></div><div class="p1"><b><br /></b></div><div class="p1">Unlike price, where similar products need not compete for promotions budget, visibility has a strong cannibalisation feature built into to it. Given that only a limited number of products can show up on the list page, cannibalisation is imperative. Hence cross-elasticity - the % shift in demand of a product A due to % shift in visibility of a similar product B - is a <i>must have</i> when modelling for visibility response curves.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><b>Visibility Optimisation</b></div><div class="p1"><b><br /></b></div><br /><div class="p1">Finally, the visibility strategy needs to optimise for multiple factors beyond elasticity.&nbsp;One could ask for a greedy approach of giving more visibility to products which have high elasticity arguing that they need it more.&nbsp;However, such a myopic strategy could significantly hurt us. Ultimately, we are only successful if a consumer finds a great product at a great price and <i>buys</i>&nbsp;it and returns to buy more. An accurate approach calls for a robust list - page optimisation formulation where we optimise the overall property for net <i>conversion rate</i> among the candidates which are relevant to the user query. &nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">As we embark on analysing visibility as a key driver, I am hoping the above constructs come in handy.</div></div>
