title: Understanding Brand Positioning
---

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">How do consumers perceive brands? What is our brand positioning and what can we do about it?These questions are of interest to marketing and branding professionals, merchandisers, category planners.<br /><br />Given the strategic importance of these concerns, it makes good sense to develop an understanding of these questions through the consumer lens, without resorting to any sampling which a typical 'offline survey' requires! The 'data exhaust' (clicks, purchases, likes etc.) that our customers and visitors leave, has valuable insights to offer on these questions. <br /><br />In this post, we want to talk about the concept of <b>Brand Entropy</b>, which attempts to capture the users perception of brand and how they place it with others. Entropy is quite close to the notion of statistical variance that we often encounter in case of normal 'bell' curves.In this context, brand entropy quantifies the variance in choices or substitutions around a brand. Specifically, higher the entropy for a brand implies that users typically substitute it with other brands. Whereas, lower entropy points to a stronger brand preference or niche styling unique to a brand.<br /><br />Having a quantifiable metric to compare brands could enable a structured approach to brand assortment problems around breadth and width optimization. For example, if the brand entropy is low with high demand, we should go deep and maybe even go exclusive. <br /><br />We have initiated discussions around these extensions with category/merchandising teams.<br /><br /><b>How do we compute Brand Entropy?</b><br /><br />We essentially look at the customer browse behavior in terms of the banners they click, pages &amp; shops they like to browse, products they view and purchase. We consider the string of products browsed by a user in a session and infer the brand choices. We algorithmically sift through millions of user sessions spanning months and aggregate choice patterns. By removing noise and checking for statistical strength, we zero in on dominant patterns.<br /><br />Brand Entropy then is just a matter of computing variance of patterns around the chosen brand.<br /><br /><b>Examples of Brand Entropy</b><br /><br />Shown below are brand dominance seen around Vero Moda and Femella. It is quite clear that variability of user choice aroud Femella is much high compared to Vero Moda. Vero Moda shows strong brand preference while Femella is perceived similar to many other brands. The colour/size in the charts indexes the brand strength.This translates to low Brand Entropy value for Vero Moda and a higher value for Femella.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iBue4pSHU9k/VHhYkJWIvqI/AAAAAAAABkk/R1anf8zD3pE/s1600/vero-fem.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="435" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-iBue4pSHU9k%2FVHhYkJWIvqI%2FAAAAAAAABkk%2FR1anf8zD3pE%2Fs1600%2Fvero-fem.png&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" width="640" /></a></div><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3svDGY5IzVo/VHhMaI_TolI/AAAAAAAABkM/Aav3i4Qq39E/s1600/legend.png"><img border="0" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-3svDGY5IzVo%2FVHhMaI_TolI%2FAAAAAAAABkM%2FAav3i4Qq39E%2Fs1600%2Flegend.png&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" /></a><br /><br />Similarly, in Formal Shoes Ruosh has much lower brand entropy compared to Franco Leone.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nepZRkOpSUs/VHhZvS_3TQI/AAAAAAAABlI/WBzpUwCG2JQ/s1600/ruosh-franco.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="436" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-nepZRkOpSUs%2FVHhZvS_3TQI%2FAAAAAAAABlI%2FWBzpUwCG2JQ%2Fs1600%2Fruosh-franco.png&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><b>Comparing entropy values across brands in a category</b><br /><br />We can now look at the entropy values across a snapshot of brands within a category. Below are the results for two categories - Kurtas Women and Dresses.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m56vqcVHcgg/VHhFr0jYckI/AAAAAAAABj8/n0U143Yb-sg/s1600/dresses_women.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="382" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-m56vqcVHcgg%2FVHhFr0jYckI%2FAAAAAAAABj8%2Fn0U143Yb-sg%2Fs1600%2Fdresses_women.png&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jOjz8eU3vVk/VHhFGWt6hhI/AAAAAAAABj0/oMqgfR6oTUY/s1600/kurtas_women.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="518" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-jOjz8eU3vVk%2FVHhFGWt6hhI%2FAAAAAAAABj0%2FoMqgfR6oTUY%2Fs1600%2Fkurtas_women.png&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />Interestingly, the above charts re-affirms some of our shared beliefs:<br /><br />1) More established brands(Mango, UCB, Avirate, Biba, W etc.) in general have lower entropy values pointing to stronger brand equity<br /><br />2) Low entropy values could also be a result of niche styling that a brand provides which is not replicated in other brands. Kook n Keech Disney for instance has lower value(0.159) since it offers a niche in comic character print dresses.<br /><br /><b>Men are more brand conscious than women</b><br /><br />Here's the fun part: If we abstract the entropy concept at the gender level and compare across categories, we observe that women categories have considerably higher avg entropy.<br /><br />It's becomes a proof point of what we intuitively understand - men being more brand focused than women! Almost all green and big circles belong to women categories in the chart below.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EMo2cNIcx0M/VHgIsM9EuAI/AAAAAAAABiI/xxnH2kahpks/s1600/men.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="473" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-EMo2cNIcx0M%2FVHgIsM9EuAI%2FAAAAAAAABiI%2FxxnH2kahpks%2Fs1600%2Fmen.png&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />We'll be developing this idea further and will be glad to have your inputs.<br /><br /></div>
