<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With multiple mobile devices becoming an important part of almost every Indian household, the future of m-commerce increasingly seems certain. The relatively smaller screens and lesser properties available on mobiles as compared to traditional laptops or PCs present an interesting opportunity to simplify how users discover different products.<br /><br />One popular method to simplify product discovery is product recommendation. Such a technique works well when users have a rough idea of what they want to buy. Unfortunately in fashion, this is not the case for many users. For example, a user may casually browse through a few T-Shirts and one shoe. In such cases, the intent is not very specific as the user is simply browsing through different categories or collections to see if he or she likes something. If we use traditional recommendation techniques, the algorithm may recommend similar shoes to the user as it was the last seen item. However, looking at his series of clicks, it clearly useful to show him both T-shirts and shoes.<br /><br />To overcome this challenge, we need a slightly different approach to personalisation. Instead of looking at each item in isolation, we need to look at the complete journey or navigation of the user. Personalised Navigation is an extension of the <a href="http://sartorialscience.myntrablogs.com/2015/01/user-journey-model-and-its-application.html" target="_blank">User Journey Model</a>&nbsp;(UJM), which aims to pre-empt navigation to the user by taking into account his browsing context. We have seen how user intent can be captured from clickstream data using the UJM. Now, lets say we continuously capture the user's clickstream near real time and calculate his or her intent every few minutes. As the users browse, our algorithm can dynamically adapt to their intent and refresh the suggested products near real time.<br /><br />Importantly, with Personalised Navigation the user will be able to find the products of his interest with minimum clicks, as our algorithm keeps predicting the next best products to present to the user.<br /><br /></div>
