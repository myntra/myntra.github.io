<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">I welcome you all to Data Sciences blog: "Sartorial Science‚Äù - a medium for socialising and democratising insights uncovered from data hopefully enabling all of us to collaborate effectively towards better decision making.</span></div><div style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Needless to say, "Data Drives Decisions" is deeply rooted at Myntra and we continue to evolve that culture through diverse and sophisticated applications of data to achieve our business goals. Data Sciences is just another force multiplier in this direction. I sincerely believe that translating vast amounts of data into actionable insights via tools and algorithms has enormous potential. It enables us to reach up higher to not-so low hanging yet hopefully tasteful fruits.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">As data grows exponentially, the challenge cum opportunity for data sciences is to intelligently condense data; we strive to create rich abstractions of data in the hope of unlocking valuable insights which we did not have access to before. An equally important activity is to align data along business contexts ensuring a more meaningful discovery process leading to seamless integration of insights into our decision making process.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The goal for this blog is to stimulate inquiry into data and trigger fruitful discussions helping translate deep insights into strategic use cases. I hope to have such discussions.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Deepak Warrier, VP Analytics &amp; Data Science</span></div></div>
