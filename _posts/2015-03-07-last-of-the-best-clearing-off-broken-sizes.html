title: Last of the Best - Clearing off broken sizes
---

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><h4 style="text-align: left;">Problem at hand</h4>Online retailers are often stuck with a long tail of low stocked products. The problem is compounded with their discovery deliberately made harder due to unavailability of majority size options. This leads to forced liquidation of these products at high discount levels leading to high losses on these. Many a times these are best selling merchandise which moved faster than the others and are left in a low inventory situation.<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">Solution design</h4>Since many these products have been best sellers there are high chances of them moving without significant discounts leading to better margins. The trick being not to promote these through the main website properties where we run the risk of exposing broken sizes leading to disappointed visitors with a negative perception that the retailer is not well stocked. One solution we are trying out is to create a separate property ("last of the best" campaign) which brings together these products and create focused visibility around it.<br /><br />To create a focused visibility, we are trying out to use the sizing data we have for our customers (based on the browsing footprints that a customer leaves with us). When we marry this data with the best seller campaign property, we get a fairly compelling proposition.<br /><br />Here is how it works, a mechanism like <a href="http://sartorialscience.myntrablogs.com/2014/12/senseable-interventions.html"><span id="goog_1867645763"></span>Sense<span id="goog_1867645764"></span></a> finds out visitor's interest in real-time and beams a "last of the best" campaign story focusing on the detected article type with size filters auto-applied. e.g. &nbsp;a customer detected looking for T-Shirts and the tee size identified as <b>M</b>, is directed to the best seller T-Shirts page with products stocked in at least size <b>M</b>.<br /><br />This approach on one hand helps a customer get an easy access to the best sellers in his/her size without too much effort. On the other hand, limited availability creates that needed urgency to move the product.</div>
